 * Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.
 * Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
 * Given [1, 9, 2, 5], the sorted form of it is [1, 2, 5, 9], the maximum gap is between 5 and 9 = 4.
 * You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
